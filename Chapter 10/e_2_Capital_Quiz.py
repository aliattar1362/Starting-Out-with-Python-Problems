# Write a program that creates a dictionary
# containing the U.S. states as keys and their
# capitals as values. (Use the Internet to get a
# list of the states and their capitals.) The
# program should then randomly quiz the user
# by displaying the name of a state and asking
# the user to enter that stateâ€™s capital.
# The program should keep a count of the number
# of correct and incorrect responses. 
#(As an alternative to the U.S. states, 
#the program can use the names of
# countries and their capitals.)
